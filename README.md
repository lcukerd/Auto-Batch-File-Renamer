<h1>Auto Batch File Renamer</h1>
This JAVA app lets you rename group of files at once in a particular format. Assume you have episodes of something having different naming convention like:<br>
ep 9<br>
ep 05<br>
ep 006<br>
GOT ep 3<br>
Game of Thrones ep 4<br><br>
Ordering and finding episode gets difficult. This app will let you rename all episodes into same naming convention at once. After rename you can have:<br>
Game of Thrones ep 9<br>
Game of Thrones ep 5<br>
Game of Thrones ep 6<br>
Game of Thrones ep 3<br>
Game of Thrones ep 4<br><br>
<h3>For Devs</h3>
If the inbuilt algorithm is not enough for your use you edit it. Algo is written in:<br>
src->renamer->Logic.java->renamelogic(String)
